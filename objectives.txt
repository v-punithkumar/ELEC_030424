Objective 3 - Maximum Demand Day Analysis:

Calculate and display the day with the maximum Demand for the selected state.
Plot a bar chart showing Demand for each day of the week.
Objective 4 - Comparison of Models:

Implement ARIMA, LSTM, SARIMA, and RNN models.
Plot graphs showing the performance comparison (e.g., RMSE) of each model.
Objective 5 - Per Capita Demand Analysis:

Integrate population data with electricity Demand data.
Calculate and display per capita Demand.
Plot a bar chart to compare per capita Demand among states.
Objective 6 - Peak Demand Analysis:

Analyze Demand trends over time to identify peak demand periods.
Plot graphs to show Demand patterns across different states.


Objective 1 and 2 - State-wise Electricity Demand Analysis and Prediction:

Add a bar chart to display state-wise electricity Demand.
Enable interaction: When a specific state is clicked, predict and plot one month, three months, and one year ahead Demand.
Implement prediction using ARIMA model.
